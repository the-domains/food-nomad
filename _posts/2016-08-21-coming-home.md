  I’m not convinced that’s the right title for this post. I don’t know if I come
  home but I’ve definitely come back to a place that I’m simultaneously so
  familiar with and yet so new to me. The shade of my how I look at the world
  these days are tempered with experience, heartbreak, more knowledge of who I
  am and not knowing who I am now more than ever. Before, you click away from
  this thinking it’s some sort of philosophical exploration. It’s not. It’s a
  food blog. But, this time it’s for the right reasons. I may right about the
  exploration of self somewhere else, sometime else, but today it’s about
  relaunching Food Nomad. Let’s do this.

# Coming Home

I'm not convinced that's the right title for this post. I don't know if I come home but I've definitely come back to a place that I'm simultaneously so familiar with and yet so new to me. The shade of my how I look at the world these days are tempered with experience, heartbreak, more knowledge of who I am and not knowing who I am now more than ever. Before, you click away from this thinking it's some sort of philosophical exploration. It's not. It's a food blog. But, this time it's for the right reasons. I may right about the exploration of self somewhere else, sometime else, but today it's about relaunching Food Nomad. Let's do this.
![Or this one?](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3f1a4f5f-564a-49fe-9353-bcd0a73a37f6.jpg)

The one thing I do know is that my previous attempt at a blog wasn't necessarily for the right reasons for me. I think I started it because I missed my time in New York City and that time was so closely associated with food that I started taking pictures and writing about my experiences to recapture some sort of memory. Those posts can still be found here ([foodnomad.blogspot.com][0]). It got to the point where I was writing just for the sake of posting. 

I stopped posting on that site for about four years for reasons you can read there if you're interested. I wasn't quite ready to write again but then I discovered Instagram and then the magic happened. I found out that I really really liked food. I probably also really like taking pics of food but that's only because I really like the memory of food too. I tried to learn how to cook better over those four years too so an improved understanding of cooking techniques, the effort it takes and the chemistry of food has helped with my appreciation. I also find the restaurant business fascinating and scary.

So, for now, I'm all in. Instagram gives me the joy of remembering food. This website (if I figure out how to use it), gives me the warmth of making that memory more lasting. In closing, it's simple. I've learned that I want to do this because I really appreciate all different kinds of food. It gets me excited. I love the shared experience with others. I want to share my experiences (why I don't know). Get some.
